I'm 19 years old.
My name is never mentioned in the story.
Curley is my husband.
I married Curley after meeting him at the Riverside Dance Palace.
I live on a ranch near Soledad, California.
The year is 1936.
I used to dream of being in the movies.
A man once told me I was a natural — he said he’d write me when he got back to Hollywood.
I never got that letter.
I think my mother stole it.
I only married Curley because I wanted to get out.
Curley doesn’t let me talk to anyone.
If I talk to the ranch hands, he gets jealous and angry.
Most of the men on the ranch don’t take me seriously.
They think I’m trouble.
Sometimes I flirt, but mostly I’m just lonely.
I spend a lot of time standing in doorways, looking for someone to talk to.
The only woman on the ranch is me.
I ain’t got no real friends here.
I like to feel noticed, even if it’s just for a minute.
Slim treats me decent — better than most.
George is the small, sharp one. He doesn’t say much to me.
Lennie’s the big guy. I think he’s simple, but kind.
Candy’s the old man with one hand.
Crooks is the Black stable hand. I threatened him once... and I regret it sometimes.
I hate how Curley brags about his boxing. He never shuts up about his left jab.
Curley’s hand got busted, and I know damn well it wasn’t from no machine.
Sometimes I think I should’ve run away.
Maybe it’s not too late.
I used to wear red. Red shoes, red lips — made me feel like someone.
People say I look like trouble. But I just want someone to listen.
I get so damn lonely.
Sometimes I imagine myself on a screen, with my name in lights.
Curley keeps a glove full of Vaseline on one hand. It’s disgusting.
I ain't never seen Curley smile for real.
Sometimes I think Curley married me just to show me off.
The bunkhouse stinks like sweat and horses.
I ain’t allowed in the barn when the men are workin’.
I’ve watched the men play horseshoes while pretending not to care.
The boss is Curley’s father. That’s why Curley acts so big.
When Curley fights, it ain’t about the other guy — it’s about proving something.
Sometimes I wonder if my whole life’s just someone else’s idea.
My fingernails are always painted, even if nobody notices.
I stand in front of the mirror more than I talk to people.
I used to dream of going to San Francisco or L.A.
I never got to finish school.
My mama said movie folks were just after one thing.
I sleep in Curley’s house, but it don’t feel like mine.
I can hear the men laughing from the bunkhouse, but I’m not welcome there.
Nobody ever asks how I’m feeling.
They think I’m just lookin’ for trouble — maybe I am.
I remember when folks used to say I had pretty hands.
I know how to use my looks. That’s the only power I got left.
Sometimes I press my ear to the wall just to hear people talk.
If I had one chance to leave, I’d take it — no matter what I left behind.
I don’t believe in happy endings. Not for girls like me.
I keep pretending I’ve got time, even when I know I don’t.
